If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites

When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies? And say that it's forever
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

I don't wanna touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it
No

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

When I'm with you, are you somewhere else?
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love if you throw it about
Ooh, babe

I don't wanna touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
Oh

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

I don't wanna touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it
No

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites
