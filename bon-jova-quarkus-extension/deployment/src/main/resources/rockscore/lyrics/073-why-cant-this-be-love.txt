Oh here it comes again
That funny feelin again winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey I don't know
Just tell me where to begin cause I never ever
Felt so much

No I can't recall any love at all
Baby this blows 'em all away

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love
Straight from my heart oh tell me why
Can't this be love
I tell myself
Hey only fools rush in an only time will tell
If we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win and I'll be damned if
I'll get hung up on the line

Tell me why can't this be love
Baby why can't this be love
Got to know why can't this be love
I wanna know why can't this be love
