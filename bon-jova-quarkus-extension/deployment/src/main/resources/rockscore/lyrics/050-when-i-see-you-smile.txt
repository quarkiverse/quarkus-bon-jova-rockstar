Sometimes I wonder how I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue

'Cause sometimes it seems like this world's closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me

Sometimes I wanna give up, wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you baby
And everything's alright, everything's alright

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, oh

I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby when I see you smile at me
Oh, yeah

Baby there's nothing in this world that could ever do
What a touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
Hey

And when the rain is falling, I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now
And one look at you baby
Is all I'll ever need, is all I'll ever need

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, oh

I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, baby when I see you smile at me

Sometimes I wanna give up, I wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you baby
And everything's alright
Hey, everything's alright
It's alright

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, oh

I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile, oh yeah
Baby when I see you smile
Smile at me
