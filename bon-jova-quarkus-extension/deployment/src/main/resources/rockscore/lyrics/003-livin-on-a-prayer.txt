Once upon a time not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough

Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay
For love, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot."

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it. I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
What he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough

Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay, someday

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it. I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

Livin' on a prayer

We've gotta hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
