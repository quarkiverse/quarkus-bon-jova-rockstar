As I sit in this smokey room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend

Remember when we used to park
Out on Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat baby

Remember how we used to talk
About busting out
We'd break their hearts
Together forever

Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Holdin' on we gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

Remember days of skipping school
Racing cars and being cool
With a six pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go

Remember at the prom that night
You and me we had a fight
But the band they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong

We danced so close
We danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together forever

Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Holdin' on we gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

I guess you'd say we used to talk
About busting out
We'd break their hearts
Together forever

Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Holdin' on we gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
