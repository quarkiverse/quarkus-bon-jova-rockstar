A vacation in a foreign land, Uncle Sam does the best he can
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

Now you remember what the draft man said, nothing to do all day but stay in bed
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

You'll be the hero of the neighbourhood, nobody knows that you've left for good
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

Smiling faces as you wait to land, but once you get there no-one gives a damn
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

Hand grenades flying over your head

Missiles flying over your head, if you want to survive get out of bed
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

Shots ring out in the dead of night, the sergeant calls 'Stand up and fight!'
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

You've got your orders better shoot on sight, your finger's on the trigger but it don't seem right
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

Night is falling and you just can't see, is this illusion or reality?
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army, in the army now
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

Oh-oo-oh you're in the army, in the army now
Oh-oo-oh you're in the army, in the army now
Oh-oo-oh you're in the army, in the army now
