Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound of my gun
Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?

They said when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But, man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain

Run away, run away from the pain, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away

Janie got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run

What did her daddy do?
It's Janie's last I.O.U.
She had to take him down easy and put a bullet in his brain
She said, "'Cause nobody believes me. The man was such a sleeze
He ain't never gonna be the same"

Run away, run away from the pain, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away

Janie's got a gun
Janie got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Now everybody is on the run

Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run (Honey, honey, what's the problem?)
Because Janie got a gun (Tell me it ain't right)
Janie got a gun (Was it Daddy's cradle robbing that)
Her dog day's just begun (Made you scream at night?)
Now everybody is on the run
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
