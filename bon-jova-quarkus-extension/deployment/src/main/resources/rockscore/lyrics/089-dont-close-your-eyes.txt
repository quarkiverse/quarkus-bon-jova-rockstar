Whatcha doing out in the night time
Why'd ya' call me on the phone
Your mama can't solve your problems
When's daddy ever gonna get home
So you did your little move and cried
In the middle of a suicide

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby

There's no one there to hold you
No one hears your scream
You live life up and down
Your nightmare's are your dreams
I know it's lonely when your hanging 'round
Don't ya' take it lying down - no, no
Hold on - Hold on tight
I'll make everything all right
Wake up - Don't go to sleep
I pray the lord your soul to keep

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby
