I get up
And nothing gets me down
You got it tough
I've seen the toughest all around

And I know
Baby, just how you feel
You've got to roll
With the punches to get to what's real

Oh can't you see me standing here
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh can't you see what I mean?

Might as well jump. Jump!
Might as well jump
Go ahead, jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump

Ah-oh, hey you! Who said that?
Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know
You won't know until you begin

So can't you see me standing here
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh can't you see what I mean?

Might as well jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Jump!

Might as well jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Get it and jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump

Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
